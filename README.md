# TSPProject-COMM618-DiscreteOptimization

This project explores the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for real-world as well as synthetic data by using linear programming (LP) features of [Gurobi optimization](https://www.gurobi.com/) and manually adding relevant constraints without using more advanced functionalities.
